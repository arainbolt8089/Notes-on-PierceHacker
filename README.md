## MyPierce Tutorial

- Needs Tips and Tricks

  - **Online Registeration** A lot of misteps can happen causing a class to be dropped and depending on waitlist, cause the student to not get back into the class. This is where tips and tricks would be helpful
  
    - Example: At times the eSchedule will show a class as open so the student would go into their Online Registration and drop a class they've already registered for to allow them to noe add this new class that they just saw as open. Except when they went to add that class an error messaged appeared stating the class is full. So now the student didnt get the class they were excited about nor can they get back into the class they orginally had. The tip would be to ALWAYS add the newly wanted class first before dropping any classes. The Online Registration will allow the student to add classes that overlap.

  - **eSchedules** could have a tip and trick starting that anyone who has valid Drivers License, valid Vehicle Registration, Vehicle Insurance and **NO** Criminal History can take classes on base, its not just availible to military personnel.
     - This could be extremly important if the needed class isnt being offered that quarter at any of the other locations. This oversight could cause a student to miss an application or graduation deadline.
     
- [**Current Issues**] The tutorial for MyPierce looks rushed and seems somewhat confusing. I know how to navigate the portal and reading the tutorial made me question it, imagine if the user had never been to the portal before. The way it was done would be good for topics that are self explanatory, but some features need more indepth attention. The heading should be MyPierce Portal and once clicked into it then options for each category should exisit. 

   - Example: How to Register/Drop/Add a class and **NOT** make a mistake.
